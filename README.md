the opinionated operating system

this is a monorepo that contains some good stuff for building and maintaining pluto.

# what is plutoOS????
well check out the website: [pluto.77z.dev](https://pluto.77z.dev)!

it's highly opinionated, so don't get mad, but a quick rundown is
- an immutable root filesystem
- atomic and reliable updates
- behaves like other distros (arch and debian) when needed using container magic
- systemd as much as possible
- a/b partitioning
- (currently) a bias towards intel cpus
- battery and performance optimizations
- kde plasma!!

a lot of the server side stuff is closed source at the moment but might be opened in the future.
